<h1 style={color:"skyblue"}>CSE-19 FileBin</h1>


A dedicated website to store all our files in one-place. This site contains all our courses, the related books, slides, lecture notes and previous questions. Using one google drive account for 120 users was never a good idea. Finding any file from that pile of junk was a nightmare. This is why we’ve come up with this solution. Link to the site:

Instructions: 

***NEVER SHARE THE LINK TO THIS SITE TO ANYONE*** 

I’ll be adding authentication within next week so that no-one can enter the site without an account. Until then please don’t share the link with anyone. 

[Using the site]

-All the files in this site are stored according to our subjects. You can choose a subject and get 


      1. Related Books 

      2. Lecture Notes 

      3. Slides 

      4. Previous Questions 
      
      5. Recorded Classes
      

- Clicking on a file name will download the file so that you can use it or store it somewhere 

- Don’t use the “Sessionals”, “Competitive Programming” pages. They’re under-construction. 

 

[Uploading files]

-Only CRs will add new files to the site. If you want any files to be added, just give it to them and they’ll do it for you 

-[Note for CRs]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

-You can only add one file per-page at one go. If you want to add more files to the same page you need to add some other file to some other page and then come back to this page. (This is a feature, not a bug *ahem ahem*) 

-Use the link below to convert the files as I’ve shown you before 

https://sites.google.com/site/gdocs2direct/home

We’ll be updating the site as we go. So feel free to report any bugs that you find while using the site.
